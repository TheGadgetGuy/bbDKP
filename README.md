## ABOUT

bbDKP is a Dragon Kill Points Mod for your phpBB3 Bulletin board.

Dragon kill points are a form of currency in guilds, where members bid on game loot and buy the items, paying in DKP. 

Different forms of DKP exist and bbDKP supports four point systems : Standard DKP, Time based DKP, Zero sum and EPGP. they can be combined with each other, except zero sum can't be combined with EPGP. 

bbDKP has Game, Guild and DKP management functions built into your phpBB3 Forum.
